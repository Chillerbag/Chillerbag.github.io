Zoe Stellamanns (my lovely girlfriend), Ryan Kitchen, Luke Bosnic, and myself entered the Unimelb game makers club summer game jam 2024!!

The title is *Speed Re:View*

---


The theme was 'speedrun' so we made a very literal game where you speedrun reviewing speedruns for authenticity! 

A lot got cut out and may be added / fixed down the line, but hopefully its enjoyable!

{: data-content="Skills"}

In this project, I used Unity and C# for the programming. 
Additionally, I coordinated the use of git and set up the repo.

It was a huge learning experience with git, especially coordinating merges into branches and ensuring an appropriate gitignore.

I massively skilled up my C# and Unity skills, of which I had little prior. 

Hopefully, this learning will be shown in future game jam projects!
