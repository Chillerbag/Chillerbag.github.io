Momentum Master was my final project in university, and was a full stack app consisting of the frontend in the Flutter framework - written in Dart, 
the backend REST API in TypeScript with Node.js, and the database, built with Redis. 
It was a super fun project that I no longer have rights to the code for, but I do have screenshots and snippets I will add here soon!


Note - This page is incomplete. It will be updated with more info in the near future.
