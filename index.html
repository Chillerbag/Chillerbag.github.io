                    on the internet I go by computer games, chillerbag, ars arcanum, or drones in the sky over new jersey. 
                    I'm a software engineer increasingly trying to become better at my creative pursuits in and outside
                    programming as I find it the ultimate fulfilment. 
                    This site is raw html, css, and js. I want to do more
                    of it in js but I don't have any concrete ideas right now. It's also still under construction!

                    Yeah I was gonna read some Parenti after Foucault but I'm a little critical theory exhausted. Honestly, haven't read much Joyce so just starting this one 
                    out of a bit of a sense of cultural obligation. So far its alright, I really enjoy the free dialogue, it's hard to make that style of writing well refined 
                    because we all start by writing stream of thought and then condense it. Its impressive how it manages to feel refined despite this.

                    Revue Starlight. uhh. You know when you're a kid and you imagine your very banal activites as some grand battle and the people in your class as 
                    these kind of unique antagonists and protagonists? That's what revue starlight is about, the magical realism we conjure up in our own minds to make 
                    the standardness of existence tolerable. Well I guess that puts me somewhere in the middle. It's pretty and surprisingly absurd.

                    Fire Emblem Awakening, a lot of fun. I really do enjoy 
                    the god complex it gives me when making characters fall in love. The strategy components are pretty fun, if not for the 
                    fantasy of being part of a group of revolutionaries.
