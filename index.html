                    on the internet I go by computer games, chillerbag, ars arcanum, or drones in the sky over new jersey. 
                    I'm a software engineer increasingly trying to become better at my creative pursuits in and outside
                    programming as I find it the ultimate fulfilment.

                    I DESPISE nonchalance, it is the enemy of the spirit. If you subscribe to the dogma of single-texting soul sucking rituals, you have voluntarily
                    prescribed yourself a set of beliefs influenced only by a grey consensus and a unified delusion of normalcy; a warmth clung onto only by those who truly fear their own existence.
                    If you never find yourself overflowing with passion and yearning that informs your movement through life to be 
                    an earnest ballad with people you love: do not plague me with your unensouled embers of a person. Be messy and erratic!

                    The Accursed Share from Georges Bataille. It's a bit of a mindfuck that puts into 
                    perspective how much economic principles in their seemingly extrinsic nature are deep rooted
                    in a understanding of the "totality" of humanity. I'm up to vol 3. In vol 1 Bataille is concerned with 
                    defining the nature of transactions in all function, by which our constant excess energy demands glorious
                    waste. Also defines what production is "useful" (of which there is not much). 
                    In vol 2 eroticism becomes the vessel by which we delve deeper into humanity, specifcally, how it commands
                    a reflection of our animal nature and concluding that our horror of our animal origins is a necessary indulgence,
                    but in erotic moments, the gaze into the animal components is what truly makes us human.

                    Girls' Last Tour. It's cute! not got that many thoughts atp. It's nice to think that after 
                    the end of everything you'll at least have a friend to keep you company amidst the weight 
                    that nothing matters anymore and never will again. Its about being there for each other, 
                    even if thats just messing around.

                    Fire Emblem Awakening!!! This game rules. I really do enjoy 
                    the characters and their interaction, and I couldn't have gotten 
                    into it without that element. I really don't want any of my little guys to die!
                    The characters are so great that it makes you really delve into the depths of the 
                    strategy in this game, because you don't wanna lose them and interactions with them!
                    (esp if you have headcanons about who will marry who and second gen units).
